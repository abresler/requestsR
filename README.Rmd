`requestsR` : Python's Requests module for R

Ref: <http://docs.python-requests.org/>

>_"Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python {and now R}, built for human beings. You are currently looking at the documentation of the development release.."_

### Background

R has a number of great packages for interacting with web data but
it still lags behind Python in large part because of the power and ease of use of the
Requests module.  

This package aims to port those powers to R, I like to think of this package as the [Bo Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Jackson) of web interaction tools.

It is fast, agile, powerful, clean and now it plays 2 languages!

### Caveats

.  This is not intended to replace `httr`, `curl`, `rvest`, or whatever package you use to interact with web data.  In fact, in many cases you will want to use `requestsR` in concert with those packages, especially `curl` and `rvest`.  I have found that `requestsR` comes in most handy for very complex web scraping tasks that require multiple headers, parameters and cookies.

### Installation

This package requires Python and the `requests` module.

To install Requests in R you can run:

```{r eval = F}
system("pip install requests")
```

### Work-horse functions

- `import_requests`: imports requests module for full use in R
- `Get`: mimics python get request 
- `post`: mimics python post request

### Other functions

- `Head`: mimics python head request
- `delete`: mimcs python delete request
- `put`: mimics python put request

#### Mungers

- `convert_dictionary_to_list`: converts dictionary to list
- `parse_from_html`: parses html from response object
- `parse_from_json`: parses JSON from response object

### Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("abresler/requestsR")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
options(width=120)
```

### Usage 

This will demonstrate how to replicate some of the examples from the `requests` [quickstart](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) documentation.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(requestsR)
library(reticulate)
```

### Basic get request

```{r eval = F}
resp <-
  Get(url = 'https://api.github.com/events')

json_data <-
  resp %>%
  parse_from_json(is_data_frame = F)

json_data
```

### Basic post request

```{r eval = F}
resp <- 
  post(url = 'http://httpbin.org/post', data = list(key = "value"))
resp %>% 
  parse_from_json(is_data_frame = FALSE)
```

### Getting with payloads

```{r eval = F}
payload <- 
  "{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}" %>% 
  convert_dictionary_to_list()
resp <- 
  Get(url = 'http://httpbin.org/get', params = payload)
resp %>% 
  parse_from_json()
```

### Complex posts

```{r eval = F}
payload <-
  "{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}" %>%
  convert_dictionary_to_list()
resp <-
  post("http://httpbin.org/post", data = payload, headers = headers)
resp$text
resp$headers
resp %>%
  parse_from_json()
```

### Posting with tuples

```{r eval = F}
payload <-
  tuple(tuple('key1', 'value1'),
        tuple('key1', 'value2'))
resp <- 
  post('http://httpbin.org/post', data = payload)
```

### Cookies and interchanging dictionaries with lists

```{r eval = F}

cookies <-
  dict(cookies_are = 'working')

cookies_list <-
  list(cookies_are = 'working')

resp <-
  Get(url = 'http://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies = cookies)

resp2 <-
  Get(url = 'http://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies = cookies_list)

resp$text == resp2$text
```
